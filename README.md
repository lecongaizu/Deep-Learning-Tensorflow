# Tensorflow-Neural-Networks
This source is implemented some neural networks using Tensorflow framework.

I used to MNIST dataset for testing all code

1_Neuralnetworks: Neural Network, Convolutional Neural Network . 

2_AE: Autoencoder.

3_VAE: Variational Autoencoders.

4_GAN: Generative adversarial network.
